## Vue Recommended Learning Path

## VueMastery: **Intro to Vue**

ðŸ‘‡

## VueMastery: **Real World Vue.js**

ðŸ‘‡

## VueSchool: **Vuex for Everyone**

- An intro to Vuex
- Supplementary course - VueMastery: **Mastering Vuex** - This course provides overlapping knowledge on Vuex.
  Reinforce what you learnt and you might even understand something you missed out from a different teacher.
  ðŸ‘‡

## VueSchool: **The Vue.js Master Class (Vue 2)**

- Reinforce what you learnt in the first 2 courses, and additionally they are lessons on
  Vue Router, Vuex, Higher Order Functions, integration with Firebase, and more.
  These are some of the advanced concepts here. Hopefully you are not overwhelmed at this point.
- For now, we do not have any projects using Firebase. You might want to skip that part, but no harm if you can learn that as well. Depends on you.
- By completing this course, you are considered to have complete and advanced knowledge on Vue. You can practically build almost anything already at this point. Congratulations if you made it this far. But there are more things for you to learn, namely Pinia as a replacement for Vuex, and Vue 3 + Composition API.
  ðŸ‘‡

## VueMastery: **From Vue 2 to Vue 3**

- Learn about the differences and changes. I encourage new projects to use Vue 3, only for maintenance project we need Vue 2. That's why you can't just learn one version. Starting with Vue 2, and then "upgrade" your knowledge is a good path, in my opinion.
- Supplementary course - VueSchool: **What is new in Vue 3**
- Overlapping knowledge to really drill it down.
  ðŸ‘‡

## VueSchool: **Rapid Development with Vite**

- Supplementary course - VueMastery: **Lightning Fast Builds w/ Vite** [Google Drive]
- We are mainly using AEM and Vue CLI, but yes, upcoming new projects will definitely be using Vite, Pinia and Vue 3 already.
  ðŸ‘‡

## VueMastery: **Vue 3 Composition API**

ðŸ‘‡

## VueSchool: **Vue 3 Composition API**

- Supplementary course - VueMastery: Real World Vue 3 (Composition API) [Google Drive]
- This one is also an extra practical usage demonstration of Vue 3.
  ðŸ‘‡

## (OPTIONAL) VueSchool: **Visual Studio Code for Vue.js Developers**

- Set up your local IDE to maximize efficiency and productivity when building Vue app.
- Optional, but recommended.
  ðŸ‘‡

## VueMastery - **Utility-First CSS with Tailwind**

Learn about Tailwind. This is a very important course.
ðŸ‘‡

## VueMastery - **Touring Vue Router**

This is also regarding Vue Router, but in a much shorter and more digestible form than the VueSchool one (below).
The VueSchool one seems too deep and too into the details.
ðŸ‘‡

## (OPTIONAL) VueSchool: **Vue Router 4 for Everyone**

- Really really deep into Vue Router, learn the ins and outs of it.
- If you need to set up a brand new project by yourself, then of course you need this.
- But, as someone new to Vue, we don't expect you to set up a new project from scratch by yourself, you will usually get support from me.
- So, this is optional, maybe if you are keen, you can come back to this after you have done the other courses.
  ðŸ‘‡

## VueMastery: **Pinia Fundamentals**

- So Pinia is something even better than Vuex.
  Definitely will be using this in the new project, and in fact one of our projects is running Vue 3 Composition API with Pinia.
- However, you also need to know Vuex as we too have existing projects using it.
  ðŸ‘‡

## VueSchool: **Pinia, The Enjoyable Vue Store**

- VueMastery's course on Pinia is more like quick bits. This one is more detailed and longer.
  ðŸ‘‡

## (OPTIONAL) VueMastery - **Component Design Patterns (Vue 2 or 3)**

This course teaches you how to think and design a reusable component in Vue.
ðŸ‘‡

## (OPTIONAL) VueMastery - **Vue 3 Forms**

## (OPTIONAL) VueMastery - **Validating Vue 3 Forms**

These 2 courses focus on working with forms in Vue 3.
ðŸ‘‡

## CHOOSE 1: Choice A - VueSchool: **The Vue.js 3 Masterclass**

- The ultimate course. Whatever you learnt previously all comes into play.
- It is 17 hours long. I haven't watched the lessons myself, but I will very soon. I recommend this only after you watch all the other previous ones.

=== OR ===

## CHOOSE 1: Choice B - VueMastery - **Build a Gmail Clone with Vue 3**

Same purpose as the above course, this one is a practical application of what you have learnt, see it in action.
Perhaps you can choose one to watch

## Where to go from here?

If you made it this far, you are very well-equipped already.
For now, I recommend you to come up with an idea of a simple app of your own, and try to build it.

Next, when you are confident in the basics, you can move on to any course you want in VueSchool.
I recommend these:

- Unit Testing for Vue using Jest
- E2E Testing with Vue using Cypress
- Form Validation with VeeValidate (the OPTIONAL course listed above)
